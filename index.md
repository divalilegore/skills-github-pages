I am dedicated to service through compassion and leaving a lasting positive impression on others. I always strive to be a reliable person in personal relationships in general and especially in a business or educational setting. I strongly value reciprocity and education in all aspects of my life. Most recently, I worked at the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau in the Consumer Response and Education division of the Bureau. I supported the Youth Financial Education Team by executing direct stakeholder outreach and working with the consumer response team to develop a catalog of our public financial education pages. 

I am an avid thinker interested in domestic policy and international relations. My curiosity sparked in Model United Nations and debate competitions in high school as a member of the Harvard Debate Council Diversity Project in Atlanta, Georgia. I continued to engage in domestic policy and advocacy work as a Global Citizens Curtis Scholar, Obama-Chesky Voyager Scholar, and Princeton CITP Public Interest Technology fellow. 

In my next endeavor, I hope to use my communication and reasoning skills in conjunction with my aim to create global change. In my free time, I enjoy playing bridge, reading, and crocheting!
